Roadway incidents have become one of the leading causes of unfortunate death tolls in our country in recent years. Which are mostly occur for overspeeding, unusual hard braking, carelessness of drivers, bad condition of the vehicles and services, not following the road regulations etc. Therefore, this project has come up with a solution that provides an efficient vehicle speed, hard brake and location monitoring system which enables the administrators and also its users to track those parameters of the vehicle in real-time and rate or review the whole serviceâ€™s quality and safety.
